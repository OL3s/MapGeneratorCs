# Overskrift

- Objectbased for each pathfinding type
- Auto-generates landmarks with algorythm
- A* is not always faster, but at most times
- ALT is always faster if you dont include precomputing time
- Dij and ALT always find same path, A* sometimes find a longer path (not by much, few scores) but is better for a dynamic pathfinding tool.
